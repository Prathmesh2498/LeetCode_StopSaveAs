# LeetCode_StopSaveAs

The first thing you are taught when you code is keep saving your code, to prevent ghastly power cut issues. 
This is a all good till you need to leetcode where pressing crtl+save will open the save as dialog box. 

Instead of breaking my good habit, I decided to make a chrome extension that blocks the Save As dialog from opening if the
site you have opened is leet code. :)

Directions to use it => 
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open extensions tab in Chrome or Brave.
3. Click Load unpacked and select the cloned folder.

The extension should run automatically. If you have experience with firefox, safari, please feel free to write clones for them as well.
